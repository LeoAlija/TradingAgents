- **50-day SMA**
  - **Current Value (01/01/2020):** 7495.19
  - **Trend:** The 50 SMA is currently below the price action, indicating a potential bearish sentiment. It is also a major support level that is being tested. The downward trajectory suggests weakness in upward momentum.

  - **Current Value (01/01/2020):** 9300.89
  - **Trend:** The 200 SMA is significantly higher than the current price, indicating a long-term bearish trend. The substantial difference between this and the 50 SMA shows considerable market volatility and bearish pressure in the medium to long term.

  - **Current Value (01/01/2020):** 7267.19
  - **Trend:** The 10 EMA is quite responsive to recent price movements and is considerably below both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, further confirming the current bearish market and short-term weakness.

- **MACD Histogram**
  - **Current Value (01/01/2020):** 24.12
